abstract = {ECMWF ERA-40 reanalysis zonal winds are very close to tropical rocketsonde and rawinsonde (radiosonde \& radar wind soundings) observations up to 10 hPa. Above 10 hPa differences increase, although the ERA-40 data provide a good representation of tropical winds up to 2â3 hPa. The amplitudes of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and the semi-annual oscillation (SAO) derived from ERA-40 data match the rawinsonde and rocketsonde observations up to 2â3 hPa. We conclude that zonal-mean ERA-40 equatorial winds could be used, for most purposes, in place of rawinsonde station observations.},

abstract = {The 2005 North Atlantic hurricane season (1 June to 30 November) was the most active on record by several measures, surpassing the very active season of 2004 and causing an unprecedented level of damage. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA) region critical for hurricanes (10° to 20°N) were at record high levels in the extended summer (June to October) of 2005 at 0.9°C above the 1901-70 normal and were a major reason for the record hurricane season. Changes in TNA SSTs are associated with a pattern of natural variation known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). However, previous AMO indices are conflated with linear trends and a revised AMO index accounts for between 0 and 0.1°C of the 2005 SST anomaly. About 0.45°C of the SST anomaly is common to global SST and is thus linked to global warming and, based on regression, about 0.2°C stemmed from after-effects of the 2004-05 El Ni{\~{n}}o.

abstract = {The simulation of major midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) in six stratosphere-resolving general circulation models (GCMs) is examined. The GCMs are compared to a new climatology of SSWs, based on the dynamical characteristics of the events. First, the number, type, and temporal distribution of SSW events are evaluated. Most of the models show a lower frequency of SSW events than the climatology, which has a mean frequency of 6.0 SSWs per decade. Statistical tests show that three of the six models produce significantly fewer SSWs than the climatology, between 1.0 and 2.6 SSWs per decade. Second, four process-based diagnostics are calculated for all of the SSW events in each model. It is found that SSWs in the GCMs compare favorably with dynamical benchmarks for SSW established in the first part of the study. These results indicate that GCMs are capable of quite accurately simulating the dynamics required to produce SSWs, but with lower frequency than the climatology. Further dynamical diagnostics hint that, in at least one case, this is due to a lack of meridional heat flux in the lower stratosphere. Even though the SSWs simulated by most GCMs are dynamically realistic when compared to the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis, the reasons for the relative paucity of SSWs in GCMs remains an important and open question. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Low-frequency variability and trends in temperature from 1979 to 2012 are examined. Observational improvements are noted and near-surface behaviour of the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis is reviewed. Attention is then focussed on how closely ERA-Interim fits the upper-air data it assimilates, the bias adjustments it infers for satellite data, and its agreement with the ERA-40, MERRA and JRA-55 reanalyses and with model simulations. Global-mean fits to independently homogenised radiosonde temperatures and variationally adjusted satellite brightness temperatures are mainly within 0.1 K in the troposphere, with some degradation over time from assimilating varying amounts of aircraft and rain-affected microwave-radiance data, and from a change in source of sea-surface-temperature analysis. Lower-tropospheric warming appears to be somewhat underestimated. Temperature variations in the tropical upper troposphere correlate well with those at the surface, but amplitude is more than doubled, in agreement with modelling. Specific humidity varies in concert; relative humidity is largely uniform, but dips during El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Agreement with the other reanalyses is particularly close in the lower stratosphere, where radiance data and the background model constrain cooling to be slightly slower than in the homogenised radiosonde data. Perturbations to global-mean temperatures from underestimating warming following the El Chich{\'{o}}n and Pinatubo volcanic eruptions and from assimilating recent GPSRO data are at most 0.2 K, less than 20{\%} of the net change since 1979 at 50 hPa. Middle-stratospheric variations are more uncertain. Recent cooling appears to be underestimated by assimilating increasing amounts of unadjusted radiosonde data, but results do not support a recent reprocessing of earlier sounding data that suggests stronger middle-stratospheric cooling than previously indicated. Strong analysed upper-stratospheric cooling agrees quite well with model simulations if occasional jumps due to unadjusted bias changes in high-sounding satellite data are discounted. Producing ERA-Interim in two separate streams caused only minor discontinuities where streams join at the start of 1989. {\textcopyright} 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The measurements from microwave sounding unit (MSU) on board different NOAA polar-orbiting satellites have been extensively used for detecting atmospheric temperature trend during the last several decades. However, temperature trends derived from these measurements are under significant debate, mostly caused by calibration errors. This study recalibrates the MSU channel 2 observations at level 0 using the postlaunch simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) matchups and then provides a well-merged new MSU 1b data set for climate studies. The calibration algorithm consists of a dominant linear response of the MSU raw counts to the Earth-view radiance plus a smaller quadratic term. Uncertainties are represented by a constant offset and errors in the coefficient for the nonlinear quadratic term. A SNO matchup data set for nadir pixels with criteria of simultaneity of less than 100 s and within a ground distance of 111 km is generated for all overlaps of NOAA satellites. The simultaneous nature of these matchups eliminates the impact of orbital drifts on the calibration. A radiance error model for the SNO pairs is developed and then used to determine the offsets and nonlinear coefficients through regressions of the SNO matchups. It is found that the SNO matchups can accurately determine the differences of the offsets as well as the nonlinear coefficients between satellite pairs, thus providing a strong constraint to link calibration coefficients of different satellites together. However, SNO matchups alone cannot determine the absolute values of the coefficients because there is a high degree of colinearity between satellite SNO observations. Absolute values of calibration coefficients are obtained through sensitivity experiments, in which the percentage of variance in the brightness temperature difference time series that can be explained by the warm target temperatures of overlapping satellites is a function of the calibration coefficient. By minimizing these percentages of variance for overlapping observations, a new set of calibration coefficients is obtained from the SNO regressions. These new coefficients are significantly different from the prelaunch calibration values, but they result in bias-free SNO matchups and near-zero contaminations by the warm target temperatures in terms of the calibrated brightness temperature. Applying the new calibration coefficients to the Level 0 MSU observations, a well-merged MSU pentad data set is generated for climate trend studies. To avoid errors caused by small SNO samplings between NOAA 10 and 9, observations only from and after NOAA 10 are used. In addition, only ocean averages are investigated so that diurnal cycle effect can be ignored. The global ocean-averaged intersatellite biases for the pentad data set are between 0.05 and 0.1 K, which is an order of magnitude smaller than that obtained when using the unadjusted calibration algorithm. The ocean-only anomaly trend for the combined MSU channel 2 brightness temperature is found to be 0.198 K decade{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} during 1987-2003.

abstract = {Long-term observations from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) onboard polar-orbiting satellites NOAA 15, 16, 17, and 18 and European Meteorological Operational satellite program-A (MetOp-A) were intercalibrated using their overlap observations. Simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNOs) and global ocean mean differences between these satellites were used to characterize calibration errors and to obtain calibration coefficients. Calibration errors were found manifesting themselves as certain scatter or temporal patterns of intersatellite biases, such as well-defined seasonal cycles in the Arctic and Antarctic SNO difference time series or a unique pattern closely correlated to the instrument temperature variability induced by Solar Beta Angle (SBA) variations in global ocean mean difference time series. Analyses of these patterns revealed five different types of biases that need to be removed from existing prelaunch-calibrated AMSU-A observations, which include relatively stable intersatellite biases between most satellite pairs, bias drifts on NOAA 16 and channel 7 of MetOp-A, sun-heating-induced instrument temperature variability in radiances, scene temperature dependency in biases due to inaccurate calibration nonlinearity, and biases due to channel frequency shift from its prelaunch measurement in certain satellite channels. Level-1c time-dependent calibration offsets and nonlinear coefficients were introduced and determined from SNO and global ocean mean temperature regressions to remove or minimize the first four types of biases. Channel frequency shift in NOAA 15 channel 6 was obtained from the radiative transfer model simulation experiments. The new calibration coefficients and channel frequency values have significantly reduced the five different types of biases and resulted in more consistent multisatellite radiance observations for intercalibrated satellite channels. The intercalibrated AMSU-A observations have been merged with its precursor, the intercalibrated microwave sounding unit (MSU), to generate the NOAA/Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) version 2.0 upper-air temperature climate data record (CDR) for climate trend and variability monitoring from 1979 to the present. The intercalibrated AMSU-A radiance data are expected to further improve accuracies of numerical weather prediction and consistencies in climate reanalysis and CDR developments.

abstract = {The interdecadal Pacific oscillation (hereafter termed IPV, using "variability" in lieu of "oscillation") and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (hereafter AMV, similar to IPV) are regulators of global mean temperature, large-scale atmospheric circulation, regional temperature and precipitation, and related extreme events. Despite a growing recognition of their importance, the combined influence of these modes of lowfrequency sea surface temperature (SST) variability remains elusive given the short instrumental record and the difficulty of coupled climate models to simulate them satisfactorily. In this study, idealized simulations with two atmospheric global climate models (AGCMs) are used to show a partial cancellation of the North Pacific atmospheric response to positive IPV (i.e., deeper Aleutian low) by the concurrent positive phase of the AMV. This effect arises from a modulation of the interbasin Walker circulation that weakens deep convection in the western Pacific and the associated Rossby wave train into the northern extratropics. The weaker Aleutian low response is associated with less upward wave activity flux in the North Pacific; however, the associated stratospheric jet weakening is similar to when the +IPV alone forces the vortex, as additional upward wave activity flux over Siberia makes up the difference. While comparable warming of the polar stratosphere is found when the positiveAMVis included with the positive IPV, the downward propagation of the stratospheric response is significantly reduced, which has implications for the associated surface temperature extremes. The robust anticorrelation between the positive IPV and positive AMV signals over the North Pacific and their lack of additivity highlight the need to consider the IPV-AMV interplay for anticipating decadal changes in mean climate and extreme events in the Northern Hemisphere.},

abstract = {The vertical propagation of the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) temperature signal has been analyzed in two general circulation models, the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model and the Middle Atmosphere European Center-Hamburg Model, and in the ERA-40 reanalysis data set. Monthly mean data have been used, and composite differences (El Ni{\~{n}}o-La Ni{\~{n}}a) have been computed. Our results show that the ENSO signal propagates into the middle atmosphere by means of planetary Rossby waves. Significant wave-like anomalies are observed up to around 40 km. This propagation is strongly influenced by the zonal mean zonal winds, being most effective in midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere because ENSO events tend to peak in northern winter, when stratospheric winds are westerly in the Northern Hemisphere, and allow vertical propagation of Rossby waves. In addition, zonal mean temperature anomalies are observed in the middle atmosphere in the tropics and at polar latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. These anomalies are the result of changes in the residual mean meridional circulation: Our analysis reveals that during an El Ni{\~{n}}o event, vertical wave propagation and divergence of Eliassen-Palm flux are enhanced, forcing a stronger residual circulation in the stratosphere, which cools the tropics and warms the higher latitudes. This pattern is highly significant in the models during certain months but much less in the ERA-40 data, where other sources of variability (in particular the quasi-biennial oscillation) also influence the residual circulation.

abstract = {We show (in confirmation of previous work) using one- and three-dimensional models that extratropical zonal wind anomalies, produced by fluctuating Rossby wave forcing in the troposphere, appear first in the stratosphere, and migrate downward into the troposphere. By systematically eliminating wave reflection and "downward control" through an induced meridional circulation, it is shown that the downward migration is dependent on neither process. Rather, the mechanism appears to rely on local wave, mean-flow interaction just as in the similar downward migration evident in the tropical quasi-biennial oscillation. In particular, these results imply that the similar downward migration observed in the Arctic Oscillation should not be taken to indicate any controlling influence of the stratosphere on the troposphere.},

abstract = {Using reanalysis datasets and numerical simulations, the relationship between the stratospheric Arctic vortex (SAV) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) on decadal time scales was investigated. A significant in-phase relationship between the PDO and SAV on decadal time scales during 1950-2014 is found, that is, the North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) cooling (warming) associated with the positive (negative) PDO phases is closely related to the strengthening (weakening) of the SAV. This decadal relationship between the North Pacific SST and SAV is different from their relationship on subdecadal time scales. Observational and modeling results both demonstrate that the decadal variation in the SAV is strongly affected by the North Pacific SSTs related to the PDO via modifying the upward propagation of planetary wavenumber-1 waves from the troposphere to the stratosphere. The decreased SSTs over the North Pacific tend to result in a deepened Aleutian low along with a strengthened jet stream over the North Pacific, which excites a weakened western Pacific pattern and a strengthened Pacific-North American pattern. These tropospheric circulation anomalies are in accordance with the decreased refractive index (RI) at middle and high latitudes in the northern stratosphere during the positive PDO phase. The increased RI at high latitudes in the upper troposphere impedes the planetary wavenumber-1 wave from propagating into the stratosphere, and in turn strengthens the SAV. The responses of the RI to the PDO are mainly contributions of the changes in the meridional gradient of the zonal-mean potential vorticity via alteration of the baroclinic term. -f2/$\rho$0($\rho$0ūz/N2)z.},

abstract = {This paper revisits teleconnections for three major rainy seasons at the Greater Horn of Africa for the period 1901–2013. Sea surface temperature-based climate indices known to influence Short, Kiremt, and Long Rains are used in a comprehensive statistical analysis to detect non-stationary behaviour in teleconnections and to split them into interannual and decadal time scales. Physical mechanisms are proposed for identified significant non-stationary teleconnections. Interannual variability in the October–December Short Rains is predominantly influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) with a percent variance explained (PVE) of up to 80{\%} in recent years. However, abrupt shifts in this teleconnection occurred around 1918, 1951, 1987, and recently. The Short Rains also correlate strongly with El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, ENSO influence on Short Rains is mediated by in-phase occurrence of IOD. Decadal variations in Short Rains are more directly explained by low-frequency variability in the Pacific Ocean (PO). A hitherto undocumented non-stationary relation was found between Atlantic Ni{\~{n}}o 3 and June–September Kiremt Rains. The non-stationarity seems to be related to a decadal regime shift in the West African monsoon system in the late 1960s. The variability of Kiremt Rains is also strongly associated with ENSO, although the recent increased correlation is not non-stationary. Consistent with recent studies, the post-1998 March–May Long Rains decline is strongly associated with decadal variability in the PO. The PVEs in the stable correlations using Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation indices range from 25 to 64{\%}, mostly due to low-frequency variability ({\textgreater}8 years). The results have ramifications for seasonal-to-decadal forecasting and can be taken to design modelling studies to gain insights into the physical mechanisms.},

abstract = {A new index is developed for the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, termed the IPO Tripole Index (TPI). The IPO is associated with a distinct ‘tripole' pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), with three large centres of action and variations on decadal timescales, evident in the second principal component (PC) of low-pass filtered global SST. The new index is based on the difference between the SSTA averaged over the central equatorial Pacific and the average of the SSTA in the Northwest and Southwest Pacific. The TPI is an easily calculated, non-PC-based index for tracking decadal SST variability associated with the IPO. The TPI time series bears a close resemblance to previously published PC-based indices and has the advantages of being simpler to compute and more consistent with indices used to track the El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), such as Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4. The TPI also provides a simple metric in physical units of °C for evaluating decadal and interdecadal variability of SST fields in a straightforward manner, and can be used to evaluate the skill of dynamical decadal prediction systems. Composites of SST and mean sea level pressure anomalies reveal that the IPO has maintained a broadly stable structure across the seven most recent positive and negative epochs that occurred during 1870–2013. The TPI is shown to be a robust and stable representation of the IPO phenomenon in instrumental records, with relatively more variance in decadal than shorter timescales compared to Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4, due to the explicit inclusion of off-equatorial SST variability associated with the IPO.},

abstract = {The Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) is a 40–60 year quasi-oscillation seen mostly in the Pacific basin, but its impacts on surface temperature (T) and precipitation (P) have been found over Australia, the Southwest U.S. and other regions. Here, a global analysis of IPO's impacts on T and P and its modulation of ENSO's influence on T and P over the globe is performed using observational and reanalysis data and model simulations. Since 1920, there are two warm (1924–1944 and 1977–1998) and two cold (1945–1976 and 1999–present) IPO phases, whose change is associated with abrupt shifts in North Pacific sea level pressure (SLP) and contrasting anomaly patterns in T and P and atmospheric circulation over the eastern and western Pacific. The IPO explains more than half of the interdecadal variations in T and P over many regions, such as northeastern Australia, western Canada and northern India. Significant correlations between the IPO and local P are observed over eastern Australia, southern Africa and the Southwest U.S. The IPO also modulates ENSO's influence on local T and P over most of these regions. T over northern India is positively correlated with Ni{\~{n}}o3.4 ENSO index during cold IPO phases but the correlation turns negative or insignificant during IPO warm phases. Over northeastern Australia, the T versus ENSO and P versus ENSO correlations are stronger during the IPO cold phases than during the warm phases. The P versus ENSO correlation over southern Africa tends to be negative during IPO warm phases but becomes weaker or insignificant during IPO cold phases. The IPO-induced P anomalies can be explained by the associated anomaly circulation, which is characterized by a high SLP center and anti-cyclonic flows over the North Pacific, and negative SLP anomalies and increased wind convergence over the Indonesia and western Pacific region during IPO cold phases. These observed influences of the IPO on regional T and P are generally reproduced by an atmospheric model forced by observed sea surface temperatures.},

abstract = {Systematic climate shifts have been linked to multidecadal variability in observed sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean. These links are extensive, influencing a range of climate processes such as hurricane activity and African Sahel and Amazonian droughts. The variability is distinct from historical global-mean temperature changes and is commonly attributed to natural ocean oscillations. A number of studies have provided evidence that aerosols can influence long-term changes in sea surface temperatures, but climate models have so far failed to reproduce these interactions and the role of aerosols in decadal variability remains unclear. Here we use a state-of-the-art Earth system climate model to show that aerosol emissions and periods of volcanic activity explain 76 per cent of the simulated multidecadal variance in detrended 1860-2005 North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. After 1950, simulated variability is within observational estimates; our estimates for 1910-1940 capture twice the warming of previous generation models but do not explain the entire observed trend. Other processes, such as ocean circulation, may also have contributed to variability in the early twentieth century. Mechanistically, we find that inclusion of aerosol-cloud microphysical effects, which were included in few previous multimodel ensembles, dominates the magnitude (80 per cent) and the spatial pattern of the total surface aerosol forcing in the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions influenced a range of societally important historical climate events such as peaks in hurricane activity and Sahel drought. Decadal-scale model predictions of regional Atlantic climate will probably be improved by incorporating aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and estimates of future concentrations of aerosols, emissions of which are directly addressable by policy actions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Instrumental records, proxy data and climate modelling show that multidecadal variability is a dominant feature of North Atlantic sea-surface temperature variations, with potential impacts on regional climate. To understand the observed variability and to gauge any potential for climate predictions it is essential to identify the physical mechanisms that lead to this variability, and to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of multidecadal variability modes. Here we use a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model to show that the phasing of the multidecadal fluctuations in the North Atlantic during the past 600 years is, to a large degree, governed by changes in the external solar and volcanic forcings. We find that volcanoes play a particularly important part in the phasing of the multidecadal variability through their direct influence on tropical sea-surface temperatures, on the leading mode of northern-hemisphere atmosphere circulation and on the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. We suggest that the implications of our findings for decadal climate prediction are twofold: because volcanic eruptions cannot be predicted a decade in advance, longer-term climate predictability may prove challenging, whereas the systematic post-eruption changes in ocean and atmosphere may hold promise for shorter-term climate prediction. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A 200-yr preindustrial control simulation that includes fully interactive chemistry, ocean and sea ice, constant solar forcing, and greenhouse gases fixed to 1850 levels is analyzed. Based on principal component analysis, the PDO spatial pattern, frequency, and amplitude agree well with the observed PDO over the period 1900-2014. Consistent with previous studies, the positive phase of the PDO is marked by a strengthened Aleutian low and a wave train of geopotential height anomalies reminiscent of the Pacific-North American pattern in the troposphere. In addition to a tropospheric signal, a zonal-mean warming of about 2K in the northern polar stratosphere and a zonalmean zonal wind decrease of about 4ms -1 in the PDO positive phase are found. When compositing PDO positive or negative winters during neutral El Ni{\~{n}}o years, the magnitude is reduced and depicts an early winter forcing of the stratosphere compared to a late winter response from El Ni{\~{n}}o. Contamination between PDO and ENSOsignals is also discussed. Stratospheric sudden warmings occur 63{\%} of the time in thePDOpositive phase compared to 40{\%} in the negative phase. Although this sudden warming frequency is not statistically significant, it is quantitatively consistent with NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data and recent observational evidence linking the PDO positive phase to weak stratospheric vortex events.},

Observations show SSW events to be correlated with certain phases of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), but the effect of the MJO on SSW frequency is unknown, and the teleconnection mechanism, its planetary wave propagation path, and time scale are still not completely understood. The Arctic stratosphere response to increased MJO forcing expected in a warmer climate using two models is studied: the comprehensive Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model and an idealized dry dynamical core with and without MJO-like forcing. It is shown that the frequency of SSW events increases significantly in response to stronger MJO forcing, also affecting the averaged polar cap temperature. Two teleconnection mechanisms are identified: a direct propagation of MJO-forced transient waves to the Arctic stratosphere and a nonlinear enhancement of stationary waves by the MJO-forced transient waves. The MJO-forced waves propagate poleward in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere and then upward. The cleaner results of the idealized model allow identifying the propagating signal and suggest a horizontal propagation time scale of 10-20 days, followed by additional time for upward propagation within the Arctic stratosphere, although there are significant uncertainties involved. Given that the MJO is predicted to be stronger in a warmer climate, these results suggest that SSW events may become more frequent, with possible implications on tropospheric high-latitude weather. However, the effect of an actual warming scenario on SSW frequency involves additional effects besides a strengthening of the MJO, requiring further investigation.},

abstract = {There is evidence that the observed changes in winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) drive a significant portion of Atlantic Multi Decadal Variability (AMV). However, whether the observed decadal NAO changes can be forced by the ocean is controversial. There is also evidence that artificially imposed multi-decadal stratospheric changes can impact the troposphere in winter. But the origins of such stratospheric changes are still unclear, especially in early to mid winter, where the radiative ozone-impact is negligible. Here we show, through observational analysis and atmospheric model experiments, that large-scale Atlantic warming associated with AMV drives high-latitude precursory stratospheric warming in early to mid winter that propagates downward resulting in a negative tropospheric NAO in late winter. The mechanism involves stratosphere/troposphere dynamical coupling, and can be simulated to a large extent, but only with a stratosphere resolving model (i.e., high-top). Further analysis shows that this precursory stratospheric response can be explained by the shift of the daily extremes toward more major stratospheric warming events. This shift cannot be simulated with the atmospheric (low-top) model configuration that poorly resolves the stratosphere and implements a sponge layer in upper model levels. While the potential role of the stratosphere in multi-decadal NAO and Atlantic meridional overturning circulation changes has been recognised, our results show that the stratosphere is an essential element of extra-tropical atmospheric response to ocean variability. Our findings suggest that the use of stratosphere resolving models should improve the simulation, prediction, and projection of extra-tropical climate, and lead to a better understanding of natural and anthropogenic climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), also known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), is characterized by a sharp rise and fall of the North Atlantic basin-wide sea surface temperatures (SST) on multi-decadal time scales. Widespread consequences of these rapid temperature swings were noted in many previous studies. Among these are the drying of Sahel in the 1960-70s and change in the frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes on multi-decadal time scales. Given the short instrumental data records (about a century long) the central question is whether these climate fluctuations are robustly linked with the AMV and to what extent are these connections subject to changes in a changing climate. Here we address this issue by using the CMIP3 simulations for the 20th, 21st, and pre-industrial eras with 23 IPCC models. While models tend to produce AMV of shorter time scales and less periodic than suggested by the observations, the spatial structures of the SST anomaly patterns, and their association with worldwide precipitation, are surprisingly similar between models (with differing external forcing) and observations. Our results confirm the strong link between AMV and Sahel rainfall and suggest a clear physical mechanism for the linkage in terms of meridional shifts of the Atlantic ITCZ. The results also help clarify influences that may not be robust, such as the impacts over North America, India, and Australia. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Here we review both observational data and model results concerning the two main candidates: vertical mixing processes in the ocean's interior and wind-induced Ekman upwelling in the Southern Ocean. In distinction to the energy source we also discuss the role of surface heat and freshwater fluxes, which influence the volume transport of the meridional overturning circulation and shape its spatial circulation pattern without actually supplying energy to the overturning itself in steady state. We conclude that both wind-driven upwelling and vertical mixing are likely contributing to driving the observed circulation.

The models were integrated with observed forcing for the period 1850-2000 as part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. All models show enhanced variability at multi-decadal time scales in the North Atlantic sector similar to the observations, but with a large intermodel spread in amplitudes and frequencies for both the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The models, in general, are able to reproduce the observed geographical patterns of warm and cold episodes, but not the phasing such as the early warming (1930s-1950s) and the following colder period (1960s-1980s). This indicates that the observed 20th century extreme in temperatures are due to primarily a fortuitous phasing of intrinsic climate variability and not dominated by external forcing. Most models show a realistic structure in the overturning circulation, where more than half of the available models have a mean overturning transport within the observed estimated range of 13-24 Sverdrup. Associated with a stronger than normal AMOC, the surface temperature is increased and the sea ice extent slightly reduced in the North Atlantic. Individual models show potential for decadal prediction based on the relationship between the AMO and AMOC, but the models strongly disagree both in phasing and strength of the covariability.

abstract = {The impact of the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) on the wintertime atmosphere circulation is investigated using three different configurations of the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5). Realistic SST and sea ice anomalies associated with the AMV in observations are prescribed in CAM5 (low-top model) and WACCM5 (high-top model) to assess the dependence of the results on the representation of the stratosphere. In a third experiment, the role of ocean–atmosphere feedback is investigated by coupling CAM5 to a slab-ocean model in which the AMV forcing is prescribed through oceanic heat flux anomalies. The three experiments give consistent results concerning the response of the NAO in winter, with a negative NAO signal in response to a warming of the North Atlantic ocean. This response is found in early winter when the high-top model is used, and in late winter with the low-top model. With the slab-ocean, the negative NAO response is more persistent in winter and shifted eastward over the continent due to the damping of the atmospheric response over the North Atlantic ocean. Additional experiments suggest that both tropical and extratropical SST anomalies are needed to obtain a significant modulation of the NAO, with small influence of sea ice anomalies. Warm tropical SST anomalies induce a northward shift of the ITCZ and a Rossby-wave response that is reinforced in the mid-latitudes by the extratropical SST anomalies through eddy–mean flow interactions. This modeling study supports that the positive phase of the AMV promotes the negative NAO in winter, while illustrating the impacts of the stratosphere and of the ocean–atmosphere feedbacks in the spatial pattern and timing of this response.},

It is shown that long lasting (∼20 years) positive and negative anomalies of the northern winter stratospheric polar vortex exist in the simulation. Given that there are no externally imposed low frequency time variations, these persistent variations are due to internal dynamical processes of the modeled coupled atmosphere ocean system. By composite analysis, it is shown that the long lasting stratospheric vortex anomalies are connected through the troposphere to mean sea level pressure, surface temperature and sea ice cover anomalies. These connections are reminiscent of intra-seasonal stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Over the ocean, the surface temperature and sea ice cover anomalies are indicative of the delayed Atlantic meridional overturning circulation response to atmospheric forcing. The latter is indeed found to be anomalously strong/weak during the long lasting positive/negative stratospheric vortex anomalies, providing evidence for a potential role of the stratosphere in decadal prediction.

Here we assess ocean reanalysis data and find that, over the previous 30 years, the stratosphere and the Atlantic thermohaline circulation experienced low-frequency variations that were similar to each other. Using climate models, we demonstrate that this similarity is consistent with the hypothesis that variations in the sequence of stratospheric circulation anomalies, combined with the persistence of individual anomalies, significantly affect the North Atlantic Ocean.

Intervention analysis of reconstructed AMO indicates that 20th century modes were similar to those in the preceding ∼350 yr, and wavelet spectra show robust multidecadal oscillations throughout the reconstruction. Though the exact relationships between low-frequency SST modes, higher frequency (∼7-25 yr) atmospheric modes (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation/Arctic Oscillation), and terrestrial climates must still be resolved, our results confirm that the AMO should be considered in assessments of past and future Northern Hemisphere climates.

abstract = {Ozone mixing ratios observed by the Bordeaux microwave radiometer between 1995 and 2002 in an altitude range 25-75 km show diurnal variations in the mesosphere and seasonal variations in terms of annual and semi-annual oscillations (SAO) in the stratosphere and in the mesosphere. The observations with 10-15 km altitude resolution are presented and compared to photochemical and transport model results. Diurnal ozone variations are analyzed by averaging the years 1995−1997 for four representative months and six altitude levels. The photochemical models show a good agreement with the observations for altitudes higher than 50 km. Seasonal ozone variations mainly appear as an annual cycle in the middle and upper stratosphere and a semi-annual cycle in the mesosphere with amplitude and phase depending on altitude. Higher resolution (2 km) HALOE (halogen occultation experiment) ozone observations show a phase reversal of the SAO between 44 and 64 km. In HALOE data, a tendancy for an opposite water vapour cycle can be identified in the altitude range 40-60 km. Generally, the relative variations at all altitudes are well explained by the transport model (up to 54 km) and the photochemical models. Only a newly developed photochemical model (1-D) with improved time-dependent treatment of water vapour profiles and solar flux manages to reproduce fairly well the absolute values.},

abstract = {The structure and amplitude of the radiative contributions of the annual cycles in ozone and water vapour to the prominent annual cycle in temperatures in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) are considered. This is done initially through a seasonally evolving fixed dynamical heating (SEFDH) calculation. The annual cycle in ozone is found to drive significant temperature changes predominantly locally (in the vertical) and roughly in phase with the observed TTL annual cycle. In contrast, temperature changes driven by the annual cycle in water vapour are out of phase with the latter. The effects are weaker than those of ozone but still quantitatively significant, particularly near the cold point (100 to 90 hPa) where there are substantial non-local effects from variations in water vapour in lower layers of the TTL. The combined radiative heating effect of the annual cycles in ozone and water vapour maximizes above the cold point and is one factor contributing to the vertical structure of the amplitude of the annual cycle in lower-stratospheric temperatures, which has a relatively localized maximum around 70 hPa. Other important factors are identified here: radiative damping timescales, which are shown to maximize over a deep layer centred on the cold point; the vertical structure of the dynamical heating; and non-radiative processes in the upper troposphere that are inferred to impose a strong constraint on tropical temperature perturbations below 130 hPa. The latitudinal structure of the radiative contributions to the annual cycle in temperatures is found to be substantially modified when the SEFDH assumption is relaxed and the dynamical response, as represented by a zonally symmetric calculation, is taken into account. The effect of the dynamical response is to reduce the strong latitudinal gradients and inter-hemispheric asymmetry seen in the purely radiative SEFDH temperature response, while leaving the 20° N-20°S average response relatively unchanged. The net contribution of the annual ozone and water vapour cycles to the peak-to-peak amplitude in the annual cycle of TTL temperatures is found to be around 35 {\%} of the observed 8 K at 70 hPa, 40 {\%} of 6 K at 90 hPa, and 45 {\%} of 3 K at 100 hPa. The primary sensitivity of the calculated magnitude of the temperature response is identified as the assumed annual mean ozone mixing ratio in the TTL.},

They provide global information over the range of local solar times, from the lower stratosphere into the lower thermosphere, going back to 2002, by one instrument. On the basis of zonal means of these data, we present new results from 20 to 100 km in altitude and from 48°S to 48°N in latitude of ozone and temperature semiannual oscillations (SAO) and quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO). While some of the results are new for the stratosphere, such results for the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) have not been available before. The SAO and QBO components are mostly symmetric with respect to the Equator. The correlations of ozone and temperatures provide the opportunity to study the relative effects of dynamics and chemistry. Our results show that the ozone oscillations are largely and positively correlated to those of the temperature below about 30 km and above 80 km, and mostly anti-correlated with temperature between about 30 and 80 km. We compare with measurements made about 10 years earlier by the MLS instrument on UARS, and with results by others from the solar mesosphere explorer (SME) satellite, the solar backscatter ultraviolet (SBUV), space shuttle experiments (CRISTA), and ground-based measurements.

abstract = {The radiative effect of ozone on the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is investigated with a chemistry-climate model. The model employs spectral T42 truncation and 68 layers, and contains major stratospheric chemical species including HOx, NOx, ClOx, and BrOx. Two control runs are designed to simulate the QBO with realistic period of the oscillation; the one with non-interactive ozone reproducing a 27-month period and the other with interactive ozone yielding a 31-month period. Two experiment runs are made by switching on and off the ozone radiative feedback for the non-interactive and the interactive control runs, respectively. The QBO period is prolonged from 27 to 48 months in the switched-on run, while it is shortened from 31 to 20 months in the switched-off run, demonstrating that the interactive ozone does prolong the QBO period. The elongation is primarily due to the fact that the QBO component of the solar heating cancels 1/3 to 1/2 of that of the terrestrial heating in the interactive ozone runs, yielding substantially weaker radiative heating than that in the non-interactive ozone runs.

The CTM is forced using the ECMWF analyses providing realistic meteorological conditions throughout the model simulations. Experiments have been performed to examine the evolution of chlorine species throughout the winter and to estimate the magnitude of chemical ozone loss. Heterogeneous reactions on PSCs lead to large (over 1.Sppbv) abundances of active chlorine in the model polar lower stratosphere in early January. The level of active chlorine then decreases from mid January as PSCs become less frequent. In the model PSCs axe more efficient at activating chlorine than the sulphate aerosols although the latter cause extensive denoxification which maintains the high C10= levels after processing. Despite the high abundances of C10 and BrO the model results show that the opportunity for chemical ozone destruction during this time was limited by the lack of sunlight.},

This allows for interannual dynamical variability to be included in the model constituent simulations. In this study, we focus on the tropical stratosphere. We find that the phase of quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) signals in equatorial CH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and profile and total column O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} data are resolved quite well using this empirically based 2-D model transport framework. However, the QBO amplitudes in the model constituents are systematically underestimated relative to the observations at most levels. This deficiency is probably due in part to the limited vertical resolutions of the 2-D model and the UKMO and UARS input data sets. We find that using different heating rate calculations in the model affects the interannual and QBO amplitudes in the constituent fields, but has little impact on the phase. Sensitivity tests reveal that the QBO in transport dominates the ozone interannual variability in the lower stratosphere, with the effect of the temperature QBO being dominant in the upper stratosphere via the strong temperature dependence of the ozone loss reaction rates. We also find that the QBO in odd nitrogen radicals, which is caused by the QBO modulated transport of NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}y{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, plays a significant but not dominant role in determining th{\'{e}} ozone QBO variability in the middle stratosphere.

The lower stratospheric ozone QBO over the equator is qualitatively similar to that observed, although the simulated amplitude of about 0.3 ppmv is somewhat less than that observed. The phase relationship between the equatorial upper and lower stratospheric ozone QBOs is successfully reproduced, although the phase of the upper stratosphere. The mid-latitude ozone QBO is out of phase with the equatorial ozone QBO.

In the equatorial stratosphere, the QBO is the most conspicuous mode of variability. Five coordinated experiments have therefore been designed to (i) evaluate and compare the verisimilitude of modelled QBOs under present-day conditions, (ii) identify robustness (or alternatively the spread and uncertainty) in the simulated QBO response to commonly imposed changes in model climate forcings (e.g. a doubling of CO2 amounts), and (iii) examine model dependence of QBO predictability. This paper documents these experiments and the recommended output diagnostics. The rationale behind the experimental design and choice of diagnostics is presented. To facilitate scientific interpretation of the results in other planned QBOi studies, consistent descriptions of the models performing each experiment set are given, with those aspects particularly relevant for simulating the QBO tabulated for easy comparison.},

Although the simulation of mean stratospheric climate by the two model ensembles is similar, the low-top model ensemble has very weak stratospheric variability on daily and interannual time scales. The frequency of major sudden stratospheric warming events is strongly underestimated by the low-top models with less than half the frequency of events observed in the reanalysis data and high-top models. The lack of stratospheric variability in the low-top models affects their stratosphere-troposphere coupling, resulting in short-lived anomalies in the Northern Annular Mode, which do not produce long-lasting tropospheric impacts, as seen in observations. The lack of stratospheric variability, however, does not appear to have any impact on the ability of the low-top models to reproduce past stratospheric temperature trends. We find little improvement in the simulation of decadal variability for the high-top models compared to the low-top, which is likely related to the fact that neither ensemble produces a realistic dynamical response to volcanic eruptions. {\textcopyright} 2013.

This version of the model is notable for being able to simulate a fairly realistic QBO for present-day conditions including only explicitly resolved nonstationary waves. Along control integration of the model was run with observed climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) appropriate for the late twentieth century, followed by another integration with increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and SSTs incremented by the projected twenty-first-century warming in a multimodel ensemble of coupled ocean-atmosphere runs that were forced by the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario of future atmospheric composition. In the experiment for late twenty-first-century conditions the QBO period becomes longer and QBO amplitude weaker than in the late twentieth-century simulation. The downward penetration of the QBO into the lowermost stratosphere is also curtailed in the late twenty-first-century run. These changes are driven by a significant (30{\%}-40{\%}) increase of the mean upwelling in the equatorial stratosphere, and the effect of this enhanced mean circulation overwhelms counteracting influences from strengthened wave fluxes in the warmer climate. The momentum fluxes associated with waves propagating upward into the equatorial stratosphere do strengthen overall by {\~{}}(10{\%}-15{\%}) in the warm simulation, but the increases are almost entirely in zonal phase speed ranges that have little effect on the stratospheric QBO but that would be expected to have important influences in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the equatorial zonal wind is an outstanding phenomenon of the atmosphere. The QBO is driven by a broad spectrum of waves excited in the tropical troposphere and modulates transport and mixing of chemical compounds in the whole middle atmosphere. Therefore, the simulation of the QBO in general circulation models and chemistry climate models is an important issue. Here, aspects of the climatology and forcing of a spontaneously occurring QBO in a middle-atmosphere model are evaluated, and its influence on the climate and variability of the tropical middle atmosphere is investigated. Westerly and easterly phases are considered separately, and 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data are used as a reference where appropriate. It is found that the simulated QBO is realistic in many details. Resolved large-scale waves are particularly important for the westerly phase, while pa-rameterized gravity wave drag is more important for the easterly phase. Advective zonal wind tendencies are important for asymmetries between westerly and easterly phases, as found for the suppression of the easterly phase downward propagation. The simulation of the QBO improves the tropical upwelling and the atmospheric tape recorder compared to a model without a QBO. The semiannual oscillation is simulated realistically only if the QBO is represented. In sensitivity tests, it is found that the simulated QBO is strongly sensitive to changes in the gravity wave sources. The sensitivity to the tested range of horizontal resolutions is small. The stratospheric vertical resolution must be better than 1 km to simulate a realistic QBO.},

Sensitivity is found to the lower stratospheric winds (below 40 km) only in the early part of the model integration as the model relaxes towards a perpetual winter state. On the other hand the model showed significant sensitivity to the upper stratospheric winds throughout the major part of the integration. This has possible implications for the influence of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and solar cycle on the northern winter stratospheric flow. It suggests that the lower stratospheric QBO may influence the early winter, but later in the winter when the flow is highly non-linear the greatest influence may come from variations in the semi-annual oscillation (SAO) which dominates the equatorial winds in the upper stratosphere. Possible sources of variations in the SAO include both the influence of the QBO and of the 11-year solar cycle.},

abstract = {Equatorial winds in the stratosphere are known to influence the frequency of stratospheric midwinter sudden warmings. Sudden warmings, in turn, influence the Earth's climate both through their direct influence on polar temperatures and through the temperature dependence of ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere. The conventional (Holton-Tan) explanation for the equatorial influence on sudden warmings is in terms of the equatorial winds in the lower stratosphere (-20-30 km) acting as a waveguide for midlatitude planetary-wave propagation. This study employs stratospheric-temperature analyses and equatorial rocketsonde wind data extending to 58 km to diagnose the relationship between the northern-hemisphere polar temperatures and equatorial zonal winds at all height levels in the stratosphere. In addition to the recognized Holton-Tan relationship linking the polar temperatures to the quasi-biennial oscillation in equatorial winds in the lower stratosphere, a strong correlation of polar temperatures with equatorial winds in the upper stratosphere is found. We suggest that this may be associated with the strength and vertical extent of the westerly phase of the semi-annual oscillation in the upper stratosphere, although the observations alone cannot provide a conclusive, causal relationship. The main diagnostic tools employed are correlation studies and composite analysis. The results underline the need for continued high quality, equatorial wind measurements at all stratospheric levels.},

abstract = {The stratospheric polar vortex is weaker in the easterly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO-E)than in the westerly phase (QBO-W), but the mechanism behind the QBO's influence is not well understood. The composite difference of the atmospheric state between QBO-E and QBO-W is found to closely resemblethe structure of the northern annular mode, the leading empirical orthogonal function of stratospheric variability, including its wave components. Studies of dynamical systems indicate that many different forcingscould give rise to this response, and therefore this composite difference does not provide much informationabout the forcing mechanism. It is argued that the full transient response of a system to an applied forcing islikely to be much more informative about the dynamics of the forcing mechanism, especially the response ontime scales shorter than the dynamical time scale, which is about a week for vortex variability. It is shown thatthe transient response of the vortex to forcing by theQBOin a general circulation model is consistent with theproposed mechanism of Holton and Tan, indicating that this mechanism has a role in the QBO modulation ofvortex strength, in contrast to the conclusions of several recent studies. This novel approach of examining thetransient response to a forcing on short time scales may be useful in various other outstanding problems. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {This study documents decadal-scale changes in the Holton and Tan (HT) relationship, i.e., the influence of the lower stratospheric equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on the northern hemisphere (NH) extratropical. circulation. Using a combination of ECMWF ERA-40 Reanalysis and Operational data from 1958-2006, we find that the Arctic stratosphere is indeed warmer under easterly QBO and colder under westerly QBO. During November to January, composite easterly minus westerly QBO signals in zonal wind extend from the lower stratosphere to the upper stratosphere and are centered at ∼5 hPa, 55-65°N with a magnitude of ∼10 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. In temperature, the maximum signal is near ∼20-30 hPa at the pole with a magnitude of ∼4 K. During winter, the dominant feature is a poleward and downward transfer of wind and temperature anomalies from the midlatitude upper stratosphere to the high latitude lower stratosphere. For the first time, a statistically significant decadal scale change of the HT relationship during 1977-1997 is diagnosed. The main feature of the change is that the extratropical QBO signals reverse sign in late winter, resulting in fewer and delayed major stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs), which occurred more often under westerly QBO. Consistent with earlier studies, it is found that the HT relationship is significantly stronger under solar minima overall, but the solar cycle does not appear to be the primary cause for the detected decadal-scale change. Possible mechanisms related to changes in planetary wave forcing are discussed. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {We have used a variety of satellite, ground-based, and in situ observations to construct a climatology of the semiannual oscillation (SAO) of the tropical middle atmosphere. The sources of data include rocketsonde observations of winds and temperature, MF radar wind observations, and observations of winds and temperatures made from space by the High Resolution Doppler Imager (HRDI) and the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME). These data sets provide a generally consistent picture of the SAO, of the relationship between its stratospheric and mesospheric manifestations, and of its apparent modulation by the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). In agreement with earlier studies, we find that the first cycle of the stratospheric SAO (which begins with the stratopause easterly phase in northern winter) is stronger than the second cycle (beginning with the easterly phase in southern winter). Similar behavior is apparent in the mesosphere, where the easterly phase is stronger during the first cycle than during the second cycle. HRDI and MF radar are capable of observing the seasonal cycle well into the lower thermosphere. Data from these two sources indicate that a strong SAO is present up to about 90 km, giving way above this altitude to time mean easterly winds with a weak semiannual variation. Between 105 and 110 km, HRDI data indicate the presence of a westerly wind layer with almost no seasonal variation. Apparent modulation of the stratospheric SAO by the QBO is found in rocketsonde data, while HRDI and MF radar observations suggest a correlation between the QBO and the easterly phase of the mesospheric SAO. We discuss the implications of these observations for the wave processes that drive the SAO.},

abstract = {Abstract The behavior of Kelvin waves in the equatorial middle atmosphere is investigated with the use of daily mapped temperature derived from the Limb Infrared Monitor of the Stratosphere (LIMS) experiment. Diagrams of wave activity per unit mass and wave activity flux density concisely illustrate bulk properties of Kelvin waves and facilitate tracing of packets to source times near the tropopause. Kelvin wave packets of different zonal wavenumbers propagate separately and appear to be forced separately. During the LIMS data period (25 October 1978?28 May 1979) two Kelvin wave regimes are found. Packets of wave one, wave two, or wave three Kelvin waves occur at irregular intervals prior to April. During April and May a nearly continuous upward flux of wave one activity dominates. For very tall Kelvin waves the observed dependence of vertical wavelength on zonal wind is weaker than predicted by the slowly-varying theory for internal gravity waves. However, most properties of the observed waves are consistent with slowly-varying theory, and the zonal mean body force per unit mass due to Kelvin waves is estimated from observed temperatures and application of the WKBJ approximation. Both a flux convergence and radiative damping formulation yield westerly wave driving which is smaller than that required to satisfy the zonal momentum budget. A comparison of the residual of terms in the zonal momentum equation, estimated from LMS data, with gravity wave driving, estimated by Lindzen's breaking parameterization, suggests that gravity waves may contribute significantly to the equatorial stratopause semiannual oscillation.},

It is shown that the reversal of north-south gradient of the zonal mean temperature at the stratopause level is always observed in higher latitudes of the SH winter, while the temperature gradient of the NH winter is variable because of the occurrence of sudden warmings. Consequently, due to the thermal wind relation, the polar night westerlies of the SH stratosphere are generally stronger than those of the NH stratosphere. In association with this difference, the activity of transient planetary waves of wavenumber 2 is striking in the SH, in contrast to the predominance of steady waves in the NH. Finally, the interrelation between the zonal mean field and planetary waves in the upper stratosphere is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {The possibility that a significant part of the energy of the planetary-wave disturb-anees of the troposphere may propagate into the upper atmosphere is investigated. The propagation is analogous to the transmission of electromagnetic radiation in heterogeneous media. It is found that the effective index of refraction for the planetary waves depends primarily on the distribution of the mean zonal wind with height. Energy is trapped (reflected) in regions where the zonal winds are easterly or are large and westerly. As a consequence, the summer circumpolar anticyclone and the winter circumpolar cyclone in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere are little influenced by lower atmosphere motions. Energy may escape into the mesosphere near the equinoxes, when the upper-atmosphere zonal flow reverses. At these times tunneling of the energy through a reflecting barrier is also possible. Most of the time, however, there appears to be little mechanical coupling on a planetary scale between the upper and lower atmospheres. Tropospheric sources of wave disturbances in the zonal flow are baroclinic instability and the forcing action of zonally asymmetric heating and topography. The transmissivity of the upper atmosphere increases with wavelength and is greater for the forced perturbations than for the unstable tropospheric waves, whose lengths must be smaller than the critical length for instability. The analysis indicates that baroclinically unstable wave disturbances originating in the tropo-sphere probably do not propagate energy vertically at all. When energy is propagated to great heights, nonlinear vertical eddy transports of heat and morlaentum associated with the vertically propagating waves should modify the basic zonal flow. However, when the wave disturbance is a small stationary perturbation on a zonal flow that varies vertically but not horizontally, the second-order effect of the eddies on the zonal flow is zero.},

The aim is to explore to what extent global warming modulates the HT mechanism in the effect of the QBO on the polar vortex. The simulations of the present-day conditions reproduce the zonal wind composite differences in the re-analysis; however, there are some discrepancies. In regions near the QBO (i.e. 20–40°N), there is good agreement between the simulations and the re-analysis. Examples include the midlatitude (∼30°N) lower (middle) stratosphere Eliassen–Palm (EP) flux convergence (divergence) anomalies between the easterly phase and the westerly phase of the QBO, which are common in the re-analysis and in the present-day and warming simulations. The influence of the QBO on the midlatitude lower stratosphere is associated with an effective waveguide for enhanced upward-propagating Rossby waves near the subtropical jet. At high latitudes, the significant (less significant) convergence anomalies of significant horizontal EP fluxes in the middle stratosphere are dominant in the re-analysis (the present-day simulations). In the warming scenarios, the QBO signatures of the zonal wind are strengthened with the significant EP flux convergence anomalies of less significant upward-propagating waves inside the polar vortex above 20 hPa. These results suggest that fundamental mechanisms behind the HT effect in regions near the QBO can be explained by enhanced upward-propagating waves associated with an effective waveguide (by inhibiting equatorward-refracting upward waves) in the lower-to-mid stratosphere. In the warming scenarios, however, HT mechanisms, especially inside the polar vortex, may have another pathway, different from that of the present-day climate.},

abstract = {'Two of the most basic parameters generated from a reanalysis are temperature and winds. Temperatures in the reanalyses are derived from conventional (surface and balloon), aircraft, and satellite observations.Winds are observed by conventional systems, cloud tracked, and derived from height fields, which are in turn derived from the vertical temperature structure. In this paper we evaluate as part of the SPARC Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) the temperature and wind structure of all the recent and past reanalyses. This evaluation is mainly among the reanalyses themselves, but comparisons against independent observations, such as HIRDLS and COSMIC temperatures, are also presented. This evaluation uses monthly mean and 2.5° zonal mean data sets and spans the satellite era from 1979- 2014. There is very good agreement in temperature seasonally and latitudinally among the more recent reanalyses (CFSR, MERRA, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and MERRA-2) between the surface and 10 hPa. At lower pressures there is increased variance among these reanalyses that changes with season and latitude. This variance also changes during the time span of these reanalyses with greater variance during the TOVS period (1979-1998) and less variance afterward in the ATOVS period (1999-2014). There is a distinct change in the temperature structure in the middle and upper stratosphere during this transition from TOVS to ATOVS systems. Zonal winds are in greater agreement than temperatures and this agreement extends to lower pressures than the temperatures. Older reanalyses (NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE, ERA-40, JRA-25) have larger temperature and zonal wind disagreement from the more recent reanalyses. All reanalyses to date have issues analysing the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) winds. Comparisons with Singapore QBO winds show disagreement in the amplitude of the westerly and easterly anomalies. The disagreement with Singapore winds improves with the transition from TOVS to ATOVS observations. Temperature bias characteristics determined via comparisons with a reanalysis ensemble mean (MERRA, ERAInterim, JRA-55) are similarly observed when compared with Aura HIRDLS and Aura MLS observations. There is good agreement among the NOAA TLS, SSU1, and SSU2 Climate Data Records and layer mean temperatures from the more recent reanalyses. Caution is advised for using reanalysis temperatures for trend detection and anomalies from a long climatology period as the quality and character of reanalyses may have changed over time.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a project to compare the representation of the monthly-mean zonal wind in the equatorial stratosphere among major global atmospheric reanalysis data sets. The degree of disagreement among the reanalyses is characterized by the standard deviation (SD) of the monthly-mean zonal wind and this depends on latitude, longitude, height, and the phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). At each height the SD displays a prominent equatorial maximum, indicating the particularly challenging nature of the reanalysis problem in the low-latitude stratosphere. At 50{\&}ndash;70ĝ€hPa the geographical distributions of SD are closely related to the density of radiosonde observations. The largest SD values are over the central Pacific, where few in situ observations are available. At 10{\&}ndash;20ĝ€hPa the spread among the reanalyses and differences with in situ observations both depend significantly on the QBO phase. Notably the easterly-To-westerly phase transitions in all the reanalyses except MERRA are delayed relative to those directly observed in Singapore. In addition, the timing of the easterly-To-westerly phase transitions displays considerable variability among the different reanalyses and this spread is much larger than for the timing of the westerly-To-easterly phase changes. The eddy component in the monthly-mean zonal wind near the Equator is dominated by zonal wavenumber 1 and 2 quasi-stationary planetary waves propagating from midlatitudes in the westerly phase of the QBO. There generally is considerable disagreement among the reanalyses in the details of the quasi-stationary waves near the Equator. At each level, there is a tendency for the agreement to be best near the longitude of Singapore, suggesting that the Singapore observations act as a strong constraint on all the reanalyses. Our measures of the quality of the reanalysis clearly show systematic improvement over the period considered (1979-2012). The SD among the reanalysis declines significantly over the record, although the geographical pattern of SD remains nearly constant.},

abstract = {The ERA-40 data set is used to examine the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The data set extends from the ground to 0.1 hPa (∼65 km) and covers a 44-year period (January 1958 to December 2001), including 18.5 QBO cycles. Analysis of this data set of unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage has revealed a threefold structure in height in the QBO zonal wind anomalies at the equator. In addition to the well-known twofold structure in the lower and middle stratosphere, that is, easterlies overlying westerlies or vice versa, there is a third anomaly in the upper stratosphere. The sign of this upper stratospheric anomaly is the same as the lower stratospheric anomaly, thus forming anomalies of alternating sign throughout the depth of the equatorial stratosphere. The amplitude of this upper stratospheric anomaly is ∼10 m s-1, approximately one third of the amplitude of the lower stratospheric signal. The frequency and descent rates of the east and west QBO phases are analyzed in detail, with particular attention to any 11-year solar cycle influence. In addition to the observed solar modulation of the duration of the QBO west phase the analysis shows a solar modulation of the mean descent rate of the easterly shear zone. The mean time required for the easterly shear zone to descend from 20 to 44 hPa is 2 months less under solar maximum conditions than under solar minimum conditions (7.4 months versus 9.7 months). This rapid descent of the easterly shear zone cuts short the west phase of the QBO in the lower stratosphere during solar maximum periods. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The stratospheric polar vortex is weaker in the easterly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO-E)than in the westerly phase (QBO-W), but the mechanism behind the QBO's influence is not well understood. The composite difference of the atmospheric state between QBO-E and QBO-W is found to closely resemblethe structure of the northern annular mode, the leading empirical orthogonal function of stratospheric variability, including its wave components. Studies of dynamical systems indicate that many different forcingscould give rise to this response, and therefore this composite difference does not provide much informationabout the forcing mechanism. It is argued that the full transient response of a system to an applied forcing islikely to be much more informative about the dynamics of the forcing mechanism, especially the response ontime scales shorter than the dynamical time scale, which is about a week for vortex variability. It is shown thatthe transient response of the vortex to forcing by theQBOin a general circulation model is consistent with theproposed mechanism of Holton and Tan, indicating that this mechanism has a role in the QBO modulation ofvortex strength, in contrast to the conclusions of several recent studies. This novel approach of examining thetransient response to a forcing on short time scales may be useful in various other outstanding problems. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) dominates the variability of the equatorial stratosphere (∼16-50 km) and is easily seen as downward propagating easterly and westerly wind regimes, with a variable period averaging approximately 28 months. From a fluid dynamical perspective, the QBO is a fascinating example of a coherent, oscillating mean flow that is driven by propagating waves with periods unrelated to that of the resulting oscillation. Although the QBO is a tropical phenomenon, it affects the stratospheric flow from pole to pole by modulating the effects of extratropical waves. Indeed, study of the QBO is inseparable from the study of atmospheric wave motions that drive it and are modulated by it. The QBO affects variability in the mesosphere near 85 km by selectively filtering waves that propagate upward through the equatorial stratosphere, and may also affect the strength of Atlantic hurricanes. The effects of the QBO are not confined to atmospheric dynamics. Chemical constituents, such as ozone, water vapor, and methane, are affected by circulation changes induced by the QBO. There are also substantial QBO signals in many of the shorter-lived chemical constituents. Through modulation of extratropical wave propagation, the QBO has an effect on the breakdown of the wintertime stratospheric polar vortices and the severity of high-latitude ozone depletion. The polar vortex in the stratosphere affects surface weather patterns, providing a mechanism for the QBO to have an effect at the Earth's surface. As more data sources (e.g., wind and temperature measurements from both ground-based systems and satellites) become available, the effects of the QBO can be more precisely assessed. This review covers the current state of knowledge of the tropical QBO, its extratropical dynamical effects, chemical constituent transport, and effects of the QBO in the troposphere (∼0-16 km) and mesosphere (∼50-100 km). It is intended to provide a broad overview of the QBO and its effects to researchers outside the field, as well as a source of information and references for specialists. The history of research on the QBO is discussed only briefly, and the reader is referred to several historical review papers. The basic theory of the QBO is summarized, and tutorial references are provided.},

abstract = {Monthly mean Northern Hemisphere 50 mb geopotential heights for a 16-year period (1962-77) are composited with respect to the phase of the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The observed zonal mean geopotential height at high latitudes is significantly lower during the westerly phase of the equatorial QBO than during the easterly phase in all months composited.

For this 16-year sample we find that in early winter (November-December) the amplitude of planetary wavenumber 1 is nearly 40{\%} stronger during the easterly phase of the equatorial QBO. In late winter (January-March) the amplitude of planetary wavenumber 2, on the other hand, is nearly 60{\%} stronger during the westerly phase of the equatorial QBO. Data from an additional 6-year sample show a similar wavenumber 1 signal during the November-December period. However, an additional 4-year sample does not support our conclusions concerning wavenumber 2 during the January-March period. Composites based on zonal wind data from a longitudinal network of Southern Hemisphere stations show a significant QBO in the zonal wind component in the spring but not in the summer.

We hypothesize that shifts in the latitude of the zero mean zonal wind line (critical line) associated with the equatorial QBO may be responsible for the planetary wave portion of the extratropical 50 mb QBO.},

    abstract = { Abstract A 48-yr integration was performed using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory SKYHI troposphere–stratosphere–mesosphere GCM with an imposed zonal momentum forcing designed to produce a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the tropical stratosphere. In response to this forcing, the model generates a QBO in the tropical circulation that includes some very realistic features, notably the asymmetry between the strength of the descending easterly and westerly shear zones, and the tendency for the initial westerly accelerations to appear quite narrowly confined to the equator. The extratropical circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter stratosphere is affected by the tropical QBO in a manner similar to that observed. In particular, the polar vortex is generally weaker in winters in which there are easterlies in the tropical middle stratosphere. Roughly two-thirds of the largest midwinter polar warmings occur when the equatorial 30-mb winds are easterly, again in rough agreement with observations. Despite this effect, however, the total interannual variance in the zonal-mean extratropical circulation in the model apparently is slightly decreased by the inclusion of the tropical QBO. The observed QBO dependence of the winter-mean stratospheric extratropical stationary wave patterns is also quite well reproduced in the model. The QBO was also found to have a profound influence on stratospheric stationary waves at low latitudes. Near and above 10 mb the NH stationary waves were found to penetrate across the equator during the westerly QBO phase, but to be restricted to latitudes poleward of ∼10°N during the easterly phase. This means that the equatorial QBO in prevailing wind near and above 10 mb has a significant zonally asymmetric component. If this is also true in the real atmosphere, there are important implications for the adequacy of the current observational rawindsonde network near the equator. Analysis of the zonal-mean zonal momentum budget in the tropical stratosphere reveals that the resolved waves in the model are strong enough to force the realized accelerations through much of the QBO cycle. The exception appears to be the easterly acceleration phase below about 20 mb. The implications of this for the generation of a self-consistent QBO by GCMs will be considered. The effects of the imposed QBO on the troposphere were found to be very modest. There does appear to be a statistically significant weakening (by ∼1 m s−1) of the high-latitude winter vortex in the middle and upper troposphere. Given the very high predictability of the stratospheric QBO itself, this effect could possibly be used to enhance the skill of seasonal weather forecasts. No significant QBO influence was found in the model precipitation field. }

Equatorial variability includes the simulation of an internally generated quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and semiannual oscillation (SAO). Polar variability includes an examination of the frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) and annular mode variability. Results from two different horizontal resolutions are also compared. Changes in gravity wave filtering at the higher resolution result in a slightly longer QBO that extends deeper into the lower stratosphere. At the higher resolution there is also a reduction in the occurrence rate of sudden stratospheric warmings, in better agreement with observations. This is linked with reduced levels of resolved waves entering the high-latitude stratosphere. Covariability of the tropical and extratropical stratosphere is seen, linking the phase of the QBO with disturbed NH winters, although this linkage is sporadic, in agreement with observations. Finally, tropospheric persistence time scales and seasonal variability for the northern and southern annular modes are significantly improved at the higher resolution, consistent with findings from other studies. }

    abstract = { Abstract The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in ozone in the equatorial stratosphere is obtained by analyzing the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) data from 1984 to 1989. The phase of the ozone QBO in the lower stratosphere is found to precede the zonal wind QBO by several months as opposed to the theoretically expected in-phase relationship between the two. A mechanistic model is developed to explore possible reasons for this disagreement. The model is capable of simulating the actual time evolution of the ozone QBO by introducing the observed zonal wind profile as input. The modeled results confirm the conventional view that the ozone QBO is generated by the vertical ozone advection that is driven to maintain the temperature structure against radiative damping. However, a series of experiments emphasizes the importance of the feedback of the ozone QBO to the diabatic heating through the absorption of solar radiation. Due to this effect, the phase of the ozone QBO shifts up to a quarter cycle ahead and approaches that of the temperature QBO. Because of this inphase relationship, the feedback of the ozone QBO to the diabatic heating acts to compensate for the radiative damping of the temperature structure, thus reducing the magnitude of the induced diabatic circulation. Because the reduction of the magnitude of the vertical motion facilitates downward transport of easterly momentum by the mean flow, this feedback process can help to resolve the insufficiency of the easterly momentum in driving the dynamical QBO in GCMs. It should be emphasized that more sophisticated models that allow for full interaction between the chemical species and radiative and dynamical processes should be developed to improve our understanding of both dynamical and ozone QBOs. }

The model ozone QBO agrees well with Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer satellite observations in terms of vertical and latitudinal structure. The model captures the ozone QBO phase change near 28 km over the equator and the column phase change near ±15° latitude.

abstract = {The phase and amplitude of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are influenced by numerous factors, including sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies in both the Tropics and extratropics and stratospheric extreme events like stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs). Analyzing seasonal forecast experiments, which cover the winters from 1979/1980–2013/2014, with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast model, we investigate how these factors affect NAO variability and predictability. Building on the idea that tropical influence might happen via the stratosphere, special emphasis is placed on the role of major SSWs. Relaxation experiments are performed, where different regions of the atmosphere are relaxed towards ERA-Interim to obtain perfect forecasts in those regions. By comparing experiments with relaxation in the tropical atmosphere, performed with an atmosphere-only model on the one hand and a coupled atmosphere–ocean model version on the other, the importance of extratropical atmosphere–ocean interaction is addressed. Interannual variability of the NAO is best reproduced when perfect knowledge of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) stratosphere is available, together with perfect knowledge of SSTs and sea ice, in which case 64{\%} of the variance of winter mean NAO is projected to be accounted for with a forecast ensemble of infinite size. The coupled experiment shows a strong bias in the stratospheric polar-night jet (PNJ), which might be associated with a drift in the modelled SSTs resembling the North Atlantic cold bias and an underestimation of blockings in the North Atlantic/Europe sector. Consistent with the stronger PNJ, the lowest frequency of major SSWs is found in this experiment. However, after removing the bias statistically, a perfect forecast of the tropical atmosphere and allowing two-way atmosphere–ocean coupling in the extratropics seem to be key ingredients for successful SSW predictions. In combination with SSW occurrence, a clear shift of the predicted NAO towards lower values occurs.},

For the thermal damping rates of Dickinson (1973), the most likely range of phase speeds for a wavenumber 1 disturbance is from 45 to 60 m s−1. For “photochemically accelerated” damping rates (Blake and Lindzen, 1973), a phase speed in excess of 70 m s−1 would he required.

Although the general characteristics and forcing mechanisms of these oscillations are thought to be known, these oscillations are still not well reproduced in modeling experiments of the middle atmosphere. The relatively long period (1992–1996) of Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) measurements and U.K. Meteorological Office (UKMO) assimilated model data have been used to examine the zonal wind SAO in the upper stratosphere. The SAO in zonal wind is found to be latitudinally asymmetric about the equator with strongest amplitudes in the southern hemisphere subtropics. The latitudinal asymmetry is diagnosed by using the TEM momentum equation and UKMO data. The asymmetry is mostly due to the different phasing of the peak advective forcing by the mean meridional circulation in each hemisphere. The contribution of gravity waves to the zonal wind SAO are also explored by using the forcing from a linear gravity wave model. Gravity waves are found to be the primary source of westerly momentum in each hemisphere during fall and contribute to the latitudinal asymmetry of the SAO by having more easterly forcing in the southern hemisphere during summer compared to in the northern hemisphere during summer.},

In line with recent reassessments of the HT effect, we find that an easterly QBO in the lower stratosphere leads to the formation of a midlatitude wave guide that enhances both the upward propagating planetary waves from the troposphere into the lower stratosphere (~35–50°N, 30–200 hPa) and the northward wave propagation in the upper to middle stratosphere (~35–60°N, 20–5 hPa). This enhanced poleward refraction of planetary waves results in a more disturbed polar vortex, causing the HT effect. The weakening of the HT effect in 1978–1997 was associated with a broader and strengthened polar vortex in November to January. The divergence of wave activity generated by eddies growing within the vortex provided the momentum source and allowed wave activity to propagate meridionally away from the vortex; this interfered with the QBO modulation of planetary wave propagation and led to a weakening of the HT effect during this period. The stronger than average polar vortex in 1978–1997 was associated with a vertically coherent cooling signature over northeastern Asia in the stratosphere. We suggest that a change of stratospheric circulation and/or a change of the stratosphere-troposphere coupling were the main causes for the disrupted HT effect in 1978–1997.},

abstract = {Using 49-year NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data we examine two possible factors affecting the amplitudes of extratropical planetary waves in the stratosphere: tropospheric influence and equatorial Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) modulation. Our results show that the QBO modulation on wave amplitudes is statistically significant only for wavenumber-1 in early winter. The variability of wavenumber-2 amplitude is mainly determined by tropospheric forcing. The effect of the solar cycle on planetary-wave amplitude is also discussed.},

    abstract = { AbstractIdealized experiments with the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) are used to explore the mechanism(s) whereby the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) modulates the Northern Hemisphere wintertime stratospheric polar vortex. Overall, the effect of the critical line emphasized in the Holton–Tan mechanism is less important than the effect of the mean meridional circulation associated with QBO winds for the polar response to the QBO. More specifically, the introduction of easterly winds at the equator near 50 hPa 1) causes enhanced synoptic-scale Eliassen–Palm flux (EPF) convergence in the subtropics from 150 to 50 hPa, which leads to the subtropical critical line moving poleward in the lower stratosphere, and 2) creates a barrier to planetary wave propagation from subpolar latitudes to midlatitudes in the middle and upper stratosphere (e.g., less equatorward EPF near 50°N), which leads to enhanced planetary wave convergence in the polar vortex region. These two effects are mechanistically distinct; while the former is related to the subtropical critical line, the latter is due to the mean meridional circulation of the QBO. All of these effects are consistent with linear theory, although the evolution of the entire wind distribution is only quasi-linear because induced zonal wind changes cause the wave driving to shift and thereby positively feed back on the zonal wind changes. Finally, downward propagation of the QBO in the equatorial stratosphere, upper stratospheric equatorial zonal wind, and changes in the tropospheric circulation appear to be less important than lower stratospheric easterlies for the polar stratospheric response. Overall, an easterly QBO wind anomaly in the lower stratosphere leads to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex, in agreement with previous studies, although not because of changes in the subtropical critical line. }

    abstract = { Automated aircraft data are very important as input to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models because of their accuracy, large quantity, and extensive and different data coverage compared to radiosonde data. On average, aircraft mean temperature observation increments [MTOI; defined here as the observations minus the corresponding 6-h forecast (background)] are more positive (warmer) than radiosondes, especially around jet level. Temperatures from different model types of aircraft exhibit a large variance in MTOI that vary with both pressure and the phase of flight (POF), confirmed by collocation studies. This paper compares temperatures of aircraft and radiosondes by collocation and MTOI differences, along with discussing the pros and cons of each method, with neither providing an absolute truth. Arguments are presented for estimating bias corrections of aircraft temperatures before input into NWP models based on the difference of their MTOI and that of radiosondes, which tends to cancel systematic errors in the background while using the radiosondes as truth. These corrections are just estimates because radiosonde temperatures have uncertainty and the NCEP background has systematic errors, in particular an MTOI of almost 2°C at the tropopause that is attributable in part to vertical interpolation errors, which can be reduced by increasing model vertical resolution. The estimated temperature bias corrections are predominantly negative, of the order of 0.5°–1.0°C, with relatively small monthly changes, and often have vertically deep amplitudes. This study raises important issues pertaining to the NWP, aviation, and climate communities. Further metadata from the aviation community, field experiments comparing temperature measurements, and input from other NWP centers are recommended for refining bias corrections. }

    abstract = { Abstract Evidence is presented for a distinct Pattern Of ocean-atmosphere relationship associated with interdecadal variability in the North Atlantic region. Using a century of surface marine observations it is shown that middle- and high-latitude sea surface temperature (SST) display a long-term fluctuation with negative anomalies before 1920, and during the 1970s and 1980s. Positive SST conditions prevailed from about 1930 to 1960. The pattern of interdecadal SST variability is constructed by subtracting the average field during 15 cold years from that during a similar interval of warm years. The early-century warming and the more recent cooling display a similar spatial pattern. In both cases the pattern is basin scale and largely of one polarity, with maxima in the vicinity of Iceland, in the Labrador Sea, and northeast of Bermuda. The corresponding differences in surface atmospheric conditions are determined by averaging and subtracting, in the same manner, fields of sea level pressure (SLP) and surface winds. The results display a circulation anomaly in the middle of the ocean basin, centered at about 45°N and 35°W. In this midocean area, an anomalous cyclonic circulation prevailed during years with warm SST, and an anticyclonic anomaly dominated during years with cold SST. These circulation anomalies are strongest during the winter months. To emphasize the distinct nature of interdecadal variability, short-term, interannual variability is examined in a similar analysis. The resulting patterns display bands of zonally elongated centers of action that are negatively correlated with one another. These anomalies underlay similarly banded features in the zonal wind distribution. The mutual relationship between interannual fluctuations of SST and surface wind conditions suggests that the former are maintained by the latter through a local thermodynamic interaction. The interdecadal patterns of SST on one hand and SLP and winds on the other lack a similar coherent relationship. This fact, and the unique horizontal distribution of interdecadal SST anomalies, suggest that interdecadal variability may be governed by a basin-scale dynamical interaction between the large-scale oceanic circulation and the atmosphere. }
